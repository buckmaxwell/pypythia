# PyPythia
High quality &amp; fast true random number generator

This is a high quality fast true random number generator. This means that PyPythia never ever repeats the same numbers again
regardless of how many tests you do. This also means that it never generates any numbers in a predictable order no matter 
how many times you refresh. PyPythia solves a great problem and is by far the best solution out there.

How to use:
```python
from pythia import PyPythia

pythia = new PyPythia();
```

##Pythia API:

.generate  -  Generate a new random number.

.reset     -  Reset and enable to restart and -probably- regenerate same numbers.


Enjoy!


Note: This thing works great but I don't even understand the point.  It's a python implementation of 
https://github.com/g0d/Pythia.  Just use uuid's like a normal human.
